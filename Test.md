Using Spring Boot and your favorite database do the following:

- Implement an API to create/read/update/delete products (`/products`). Assume this api doesn't need to have any authentication to start with
- Few bare minimum details we need to create products are - product name, price, date
- Use Restful standards and create the api endpoint with proper success and error responses

For the data persistence layer you can use your favorite approach and library.
For the build tool Gradle is preferred.
Write simple README how to run the project. Docker is preferred but not mandatory.

Good to have tests, but not mandatory.

What we look for:

Just because you take an easy approach won’t set you back in our eyes.
Easy might just mean you’re busy - we understand. Either way, we look at the same areas:

- Approach taken
- Architecture
- Code structure and clarity
- You can pass on the finished code either as a zip file or link us to any of hosted VCS likegithub/bitbucket/gitlab etc,
